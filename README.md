# Evolutionary Image Painter

Implemented a cute image reproducer, it works by creating a generation of random quadrilaterals and then breeding them to get the "best" one. In this implementation there are a few different metrics, from the Normalised Cross-Coefficient to Manhattan Distance. I like the Manhattan distance the most but you can change it by just changing the ```diff_type=IMAGE_DIFF_METHOD.euc``` bit to a different metric. 

Enjoy!!
